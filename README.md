<h2> Chain of Custody and Legal Implications</h2>

<h4><ins>Description:</ins></h4> The chain of custody refers to the chronological documentation and physical paper trail, accounting for the seizure, custody, control, transfer, analysis, and disposition of evidence. It establishes that there hasnâ€™t been any alteration, tampering, or unauthorized access to the evidence after it was collected.



<h4><ins>Importance:</ins></h4> It ensures the integrity of evidence and validates that the evidence presented in court is the same as what was originally collected.<br>
<br>

<ins>Components:</ins>  Each link in the chain should document:
<ul>
<li>The date and time of collection, transfer, or access.</li>
<li>The person making the entry.</li>
<li>The purpose or reason for the entry (e.g., analysis, transfer).</li>
<li>The current location or disposition of the evidence.</li>
</ul>
      


<h3><ins>Legal Implications of Breaching the Chain</ins></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    
  **Description**: Any break in the chain of custody can lead to disputes over the integrity or authenticity of the evidence. </li>
  <li>
    
  **Outcomes**: A broken chain can result in evidence being deemed inadmissible in court, potentially collapsing a prosecution or defense. Even if admitted, its credibility might be questioned or dismissed. </li>
  <li>
    
  **Examples**: Evidence handled without gloves, unlogged access to evidence, loss of evidence. </li>
</ul>


<h3><ins>Digital Considerations</ins></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    
  **Description**: Digital evidence has its unique challenges compared to physical evidence. With digital data, alterations can be less conspicuous.</li>
  <li>
    
  **Duplications**: When digital evidence is duplicated, ensuring that the duplicate is an exact copy is essential. </li>
  <li>
    
  **Timestamps**: Accessing files without the proper tools can alter metadata, like "last accessed" timestamps. </li>

  <li>
  
  **Decryption**: Trying to decrypt encrypted files might modify them or result in data loss.

  </li>
</ul>


<h3><ins>Legal Frameworks and Standards</ins></h3>
<ul>
